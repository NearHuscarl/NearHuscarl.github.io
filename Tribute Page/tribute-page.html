            <p class="biography">
            Born in South Africa in 1971, Elon Musk became a 
            multimillionaire in his late 20s when he sold his start-up company, Zip2, to a 
            division of Compaq Computers. He achieved more success by founding X.com in 1999, 
            SpaceX in 2002 and Tesla Motors in 2003. Musk made headlines in May 2012, when 
            SpaceX launched a rocket that would send the first commercial vehicle to the 
            International Space Station. He bolstered his portfolio with the purchase of 
            SolarCity in 2016, and cemented his standing as a leader of industry by taking on 
            an advisory role in the early days of President Donald Trump's administration.
