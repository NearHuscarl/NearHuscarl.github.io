My name is Nguyen. I am currently a senior at [University of Information
Technology]. In my four-year at uni, I have written a lot of small and medium
projects using various programming languages and frameworks, ranging from
terminal utility scripts, web scrapers, libraries, UI mockups, some nich√©
android apps to desktop app, video games and web app.

My largest project, [Castlevania] is a 2D game remake of the same title. It is
one of the only 2 projects (need citation) to achieve the absolute score in
Introduction to Game Development in 2018, one of the most challenging courses in
Software Engineering major where I am taking.

I care a lot about creating beautiful, intuitive, high-performance web apps
using latest technologies and frameworks. Coding is not easy, that is why I
always try my best to make my code as clean and readable as possible whenever I
can, so it can be easily read, maintained and reused later by me or other
people. My dream is to master Haskell and write a bot that can fix all of the
garbage code that I have written when I was young.

When I am not coding. You can find me playing indie games, hitting the gym,
reading blogs or watching Black Mirror episodes and contemplate about how the
machine will one day kill us all and the only escape is a [wizard hat].
