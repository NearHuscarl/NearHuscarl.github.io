## Summary

Senior at UIT who enjoy writing code to solve problem. Having worked with
multiple languages and frameworks in the past, I have a good understanding of
**OOP**, **data structure** and **programming logic** and can generally apply it
everywhere when learning new things. Technologies used: `React`, `SCSS`,
`Typescript`, `Webpack`, `Flutter`, `Git`. Depending on the project's requirements,
I can seek to learn new technologies fast and quickly integrate into the new
team's workflow. I am also a moderator on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/9449426/nearhuscarl?tab=topactivity)
with over 5k reps and an active contributor in [MaterialUI topic](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/material-ui/topusers).
