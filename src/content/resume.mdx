## Summary

Undergraduate at UIT who enjoy writing code to solve problem. Having worked with
multiple languages and frameworks in the past, I develop a good understanding of
**OOP**, **data structure** and **programming logic** and can generally apply it
anywhere else when learning new things. Technologies used: `React`, `SCSS`,
`Typescript`, `Webpack`, `Flutter`, `Git`. Depending on the project's requirements,
I can seek to learn new technologies fast and quickly integrate into the new
team's workflow.
